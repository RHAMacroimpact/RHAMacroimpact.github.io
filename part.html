				<p class = "normal-text">College campuses serve many purposes, including the creation 
				and maintenance of multicultural and brave spaces for action and
				dialogue around social justice. Unfortunately, incidents such as
				the ones that occurred at Mount Holyoke College, Yale University,
				and the University of Missouri disrupt that idea. In addition to 
				these growing issues, the Council of Racial and Ethnic Students 
				(CORES) and the Council of Progressive Students (COPS) have 
				expressed and advocated the need for a more inclusive learning
				environments and brave spaces at Michigan State University. 
				In response to these growing issues of race, gender, and 
				sexual orientation focusing around social justice issues,
				on microaggressions in the spring semester of 2016. RHA provides
				a voice for students living on campus and strongly believes in 
				bringing together Michigan State’s diverse community, representing
				and protecting the rights of residents objectively, and creating 
				tools for change. Together we can work together to create more 
				inclusive and aware campus.

				<p class = "title-text">Our Goal</p>
				<p class = "normal-text">This initiative is a visibility campaign highlighting the faces and 
				stories of Spartans who deal with issues of racism, sexism, homophobia,
				and other aspects of exclusion and discrimination on a daily basis. 
				The campaign will function at two levels during the spring semester 
				of 2016. The first, to educate on the campus community on 
				microaggressions, and the second to encourage students and organizations
				to hold events, discussions, and initiatives on microaggressions 
				and language. Our voices often go unheard and our experiences are 
				devalued, this project is our way of speaking back, of claiming this
				campus, of standing up to say: We are here. This place is ours. </p>
				<br><br>
				
				<p class = "normal-text">Students, staff, and faculty will come together to raise awareness of
				the impact of language on people at Michigan State through a series 
				of photoshoots. All of us use words that can harm or alienate others. 
				This occurs in classrooms, residence halls, student organizations, 
				and social gatherings. While the intent may not be to do harm to 
				another person, the impact adds up.
				<br>
				Take the time to understand the power of your words. What do your 
				statements really say? What about statements such as these: 
				</p>
				<p class = "quote-text">
				<br>
				“That’s so gay”
				<br>
				“You’re pretty for a black girl”
				<br>
				“You’re dumb for an Asian” 
				<br>
				“I always wanted a gay sassy friend”
				<br>
				“This building looks ghetto”
				<br>
				</p>
				<p class = "normal-text">
				These statements intend to be compliments but can work against building
				a just campus environment and perpetuate violence against people of 
				color, women, queer and transgender people, people with disabilities, 
				and other marginalized communities.  </p>

				<p class = "normal-text">
				The first step in taking action against injustice in your communities 
				is to increase your awareness of the issue. If there is a topic that 
				you are not familiar with then ask questions, learn, and engage others 
				in conversation. The first step to acknowledging there is a problem is 
				by understanding the history and impact of language. This is important
				to creating a brave and just campus. Change starts with you. Check your
				language and the environment around you. How often are you using terms
				(intentionally or unintentionally) that could be harmful or triggering
				to people of marginalized identities? Ask yourself how often you 
				encounter people that use the same language either in face to face
				conversations, social media, residence halls, and class rooms. What
				can you do to help?
				</p>
				
				<p class = "list-header-text">
				Action Steps:
				</p>
				<ul class = "normal-text bullets">
					<li>Become aware of the problem</li>
					<li>Check yourself and your environment</li>
					<li>Talk to others about issues facing your community and the power of words</li>
					<li>When people use harmful language, ask them questions to 
						clarify what they mean or define the word: “What do you mean by _____?” </li>
					<li>Ask the person to use a different word: “Instead of saying
					_____ say _______.” </li>
					<li>Share our website, resources, hashtag, etc. on social media to spread the word</li>
