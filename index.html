				<p class = "normal-text">College campuses serve many purposes, including the creation and maintenance of multicultural 

					and brave spaces for action and dialogue around social justice. Unfortunately, incidents such as 

					the ones that occurred at Yale University, and the University of Missouri disrupt that idea. In 

					response to these growing social justice issues, the Residence Halls Association (RHA) has 

					launched its Microaggression Macroimpact campaign.
					<br>
					<br>
					This website is a resource for you and your organizations to get information on the impact

					microaggressions have, as well as on campaign events and other campus resources. Together we 

					can work together to create more inclusive and aware campus. We look forward to working with 

					you all!
				<br>

				<p class = "title-text">Our Goal</p>
				<p class = "normal-text">The primarily student-run initiative will focus to educate the campus community

				on microaggressions, and encourage our fellow Spartans to create events, discussions, and 

				initiatives on the impact our words have on one another. The photo campaign will highlight the 

				faces and stories of students who deal with exclusion and prejudice on a daily basis. Other 

				aspects also include events, speakers, diversity training, and student led committees. </p>

				<p class = "title-text">Why Microaggressions</p>
				<p class = "normal-text">
				Our voices often go unheard and our experiences are devalued, this project is our way of 

				speaking back, of claiming this campus, of standing up to say: We are here. This place is ours.
				<br>
				<br>
				Students, staff, and faculty will come together to raise awareness of
				the impact of language on people at Michigan State through a series 
				of photoshoots. All of us use words that can harm or alienate others. 
				This occurs in classrooms, residence halls, student organizations, 
				and social gatherings. While the intent may not be to do harm to 
				another person, the impact adds up.
				<br>
				Take the time to understand the power of your words. What do your 
				statements really say? What about statements such as these: 
				</p>
				<p class = "quote-text">
				<br>
				“That’s so gay”
				<br>
				“You’re pretty for a black girl”
				<br>
				“You’re dumb for an Asian” 
				<br>
				“I always wanted a gay sassy friend”
				<br>
				“This building looks ghetto”
				<br>
				</p>
				<p class = "normal-text">
				These statements intend to be compliments but can work against building
				a just campus environment and perpetuate violence against people of 
				color, women, queer and transgender people, people with disabilities, 
				and other marginalized communities.  </p>

				<p class = "normal-text">Many say that “you’re making a big deal out of nothing”, but it is a big deal and it goes deeper 

				than just words. Victims of microaggressions often feel unsafe and not included. It causes 

				significant long-term harm. Victims are affected physically, mentally, emotionally, and 

				behaviorally. <br><br>

				Microaggressions can contribute to serious anxiety and depression to victims. It’s not good for 

				the perpetrators either, causing guilt, anxiety, and depression to those labeled as bullies and 

				someone who is acknowledging the problem.

				<p class = "title-text">Taking Action</p>
				<p class = "normal-text">
				The first step in taking action against injustice in your communities 
				is to increase your awareness of the issue. If there is a topic that 
				you are not familiar with then ask questions, learn, and engage others 
				in conversation. The first step to acknowledging there is a problem is 
				by understanding the history and impact of language. This is important
				to creating a brave and just campus. Change starts with you. Check your
				language and the environment around you. How often are you using terms
				(intentionally or unintentionally) that could be harmful or triggering
				to people of marginalized identities? Ask yourself how often you 
				encounter people that use the same language either in face to face
				conversations, social media, residence halls, and class rooms. What
				can you do to help?
